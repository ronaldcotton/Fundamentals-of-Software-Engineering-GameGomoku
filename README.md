## About

This is an implementation of a simple game GoBang or also known as Five-In-A-Row.  For more information about the game, see [Wikipedia: Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku).


The System Menu allows the user to both swap between three backgrounds in the assets directory and quitting the program.  Clicking the main game board initiates black to move first and alternate between white and black moves.  Three buttons below the game board either restarts the entire game, allows taking back individual moves, or exiting the game entirely.  GameGomokuGUI Window doesn't allow for resizing.

A very minimal implementation and an early assignment for the class.
